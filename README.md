I would like to build a **Music Mood Matcher** app that recommends music based on the user’s current mood. Users can select or describe how they’re feeling, and the app will generate personalized playlists that match their emotions. Key features would include mood detection through short text inputs or emojis, integration with music streaming services for seamless playback, and the ability to save and share custom playlists. Additionally, the app could track mood trends over time and suggest songs to help users relax, focus, or energize themselves.
